        <h2 className='ds-h2'>The Submissions API enables submissions and real-time performance scoring of Quality Payment Program (QPP) data. </h2>
        <p className='ds-text'>The Submissions API is a RESTful API. It has predictable, resource-oriented URLs, and uses HTTP response codes to indicate API errors. It uses standard HTTP features, like HTTPS authentication and HTTP verbs, which are understood by off-the-shelf HTTP clients.</p>
        <p className='ds-text'>The Submissions API supports cross-origin resource sharing, allowing you to interact securely with the API from a client-side web application (though you should never expose your secret API key in any public websiteâ€™s client-side code). </p>
        <p className='ds-text'>API responses are returned in JSON, including errors.</p>

        <h2 className='ds-h2'>Object Types</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Submissions: A submission object contains any performance data submitted on behalf of a single MIPS-eligible clinician, practice or group.</li>
          <li>Measurement sets: A measurement set object represents a set of performance data related to one specific category (Promoting Interoperability, Improvement Activities, Quality), and is tied to a submission object.</li>
          <li>Measurements: A measurement object represents one single data point related to a specific measure in a given category, and is tied to a measurement set object.</li>
        </ul>
